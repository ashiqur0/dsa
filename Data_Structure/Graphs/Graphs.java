/*
Graphs: Data Structure
Graphs: is a non linear data structures that consists vertices and edges.

a Vertex: also called node, is a point or an object in the graph, and 
an Edge: is used to connect two vertices with each other.

Uses of Graphs:
Social Networks: where each person is a vertex and friendship is edge
Map and Navigation: where a town or bus stop is a vertex or node and road is edge
Internet: where web pages are vertices and hyperlink are edges

Properties of Graphs:
A weighted graph: where the edges have values
A connected graph: where all the vertices are connected through edges somehow
A directed graph: is when the edge between the vertex pair has a direction
A cyclic graph: when a graph's vertex connected like a loop 
    Undirected graph:
    Directed graph:
Loop: when an edge is begins and end with same vertex.

Graph Representation: tells us how the graph is stored in the memory
Adjacency Matrix Graph Representation:
    Undirected and Unweighted
    Directed and Weighted
Adjacency List Graph Representation:
    Undirected and Unweighted
    Directed and Weighted
