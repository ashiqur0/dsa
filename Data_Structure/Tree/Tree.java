/*
Tree: is a hierarchical data structure

Uses: 
Hierarchical Data: File systems, organizational models, etc.
Databases: Used for quick data retrieval.
Routing Tables: Used for routing data in network algorithms.
Sorting/Searching: Used for sorting data and searching for data.
Priority Queues: Priority queue data structures are commonly implemented using trees, such as binary heaps.

Tree Terminology:
Root node: the top node of the tree
Edges: two nodes connected with an edge
Nodes: 
Leaf nodes: the node who doesn't have child node
Child nodes: the node who has parent node
Sibling: if a node has two child then those two child is sibling of one another
Parent nodes: the node who has at least one child node
Tree height: number or edges from the root node to leaf node
Tree size: number of nodes the tree consists with

Types of Tree:
Binary Tree: a type of tree where a node can have at maximum of two child nodes
Binary Search Tree: a type of binary tree where left child value is lower than right child
AVL Tree: a type of binary search tree that self balanced
