DSA Theory:

Algorithm: A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.

Data Structure: A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently.

Time Complexity: A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

Space Complexity: A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

Big O Notation: 

Recursion: A programmin technique where a function calls itself.

Divide and Conqure: 

BruteForce: In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the brute force approach is a straightforward method for solving problems by systematically trying all possible solutions until the correct one is found
